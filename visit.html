                <h4>Address: Castle St, Scalloway, Shetland ZE1 0TP</h2>
                    <p>Scalloway Castle, was the home of <b>Patrick Stewart</b>, a horrible man. He became known as the
                        'Black
                        Patie', he was known for his notorious oppression. He was accused of using forced labour in
                        Scalloway's construction in 1599. There was a happy ending for him though, he was executed in
                        Edinburgh in 1615</p>

                    <p>The castle itself stands as a sophisticated and impressive example of the marvelous architecture
                        from
                        the 1500's</p>

                    <p>Everytime you go past it, its a reminder of Patrick Stewart's harsh rule. </p>

                <h4>Address: Castle St, Scalloway, Shetland ZE1 0TP</h2>

                    <p>Scalloway museum first opened in 1985, by the Scalloway History Group. One of its main themes was
                        'The Shetland Bus' the nickname given to a clandestine and dangerous operation carried out
                        across the North Sea between Shetland and
                        occupied Norway during World War 2, which we will talk about next</p>

                    <p>After 20 years of the museum being opened and run by the Scalloway History Group, it was in need
                        of some work it had outgrown its old premises. The society instigated a six-year project to fund
                        a create the museum in the photo to your left.</p>
                    <p>The new museum was opened in 2012 by tge Prime Minster of Norway. Its one of the most popular
                        attractions for visitors when coming to Scalloway.</p>
