29/2/24 - chose to do the main banner a blue colour, which you'll notie it the same colour as the shetland flag.

29/2/24 - main nav bar figuring out how to make it responsive was initally hard but then shortly after looking at the bootstrap documentation i understood what to do, https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/

4/3/24 - issue with last image on the main page, fixed with replacing the inital image with another reloading page and then putting orginal image back. (dont know how this worked)

12/3/24 - i was looking at the main page and it seemed kind of boring, so i went looking for insperation and landed on the idea of the main text in the banner to slowing float in having to learn about @keyframes, but in the end it makes the website much more attractive as sleak. 

13/3/24 - the main text on the index page wasn't scaling properly when going to moblie manged to fix this by chaning the font size from 'px' -> 'vw'


13/3/24 - regarding my decsion for the layout of page 'visit.html' i decided to make the left part (the bigger one) the image, and the right part some text explaining the image. when you read its always left to right so i wanted a big attraive image to be the first thing you see and then if you want to find out more you just keep reading and the text will be there.

14/3/24 - for the visit page we are told to impliment a 7:5 column ratio, after doing that i notcied that when switching to moblie that it would look very squished together so after some googleing i found you could change it from 'col-5' -> 'col-lg-5' and this is perfect for moblie because when it cant be loaded side by side they will go ontop of the other one.

14/3/24 - when adding in the video to the history page, i could'nt get the height to work, the width was fine but would work with '%' so rembering how i fixed the heading i tried 'vw' and it worked perfectly
