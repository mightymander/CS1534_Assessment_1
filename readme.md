??/??// - chose to do the main banner a blue colour, which you'll notie it the same colour as the shetland flag.

3/4/24 - issue with last image on the main page, fixed with replacing the inital image with another reloading page and then putting orginal image back. (dont know how this worked)

12/3/24 - i was looking at the main page and it seemed kind of boring, so i went looking for insperation and landed on the idea of the main text in the banner to slowing float in having to learn about @keyframes, but in the end it makes the website much more attractive as sleak. 

13/3/24 - the main text on the index page wasn't scaling properly when going to moblie manged to fix this by chaning the font size from 'px' -> 'vw'
