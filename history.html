        <h2 class="text-center">Scalloway Castle</h2>
        <h3 class="text-center">1599 - 2024</h3>

        <p>The castle was constructed by, Patrick Stewart,the second Earl of Orkney</p>
        <p>The primary purpose of the castle was to assert Steward's authority over the lands, it was intended to
            symbolize power and control, as well as being fortified so it could withstand any attack.</p>
        <p>Design, The castle is a typical example of a Scottish tower house, shown by its tall rectangular tower with
            thick walls</p>

        <p>later on, hundreds of years later after changing owners, the castle fell into disrepair, but in recent years
            has seen efforts to try and preserve and restore it. Mainly i assume for tourism as the castle received a
            lot
            of visitors and its a key destination for tourists.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Gallow Hill</h2>
        <h3 class="text-center">1700's</h3>

        <p>This very hill you see used to be the place where public executions would take place. You can probably tell
            from the name 'Gallow'</p>
        <p>During this time, Gallow Hill would have been a grim reminder of the harsh justice system at the time in
            Britan. It served as a deterrent for criminals especially because all the killing where done in the public
            so anyone could see.</p>
        <p>Commonly before being executed those condemned to die would have been paraded through the town before meeting
            there fate on Gallow hill.</p>
